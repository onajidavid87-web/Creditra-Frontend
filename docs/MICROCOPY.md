# Microcopy Guide

Short, scannable text that helps users understand what they're looking at
and what to do next. Every sentence should earn its place.

## Tone

- **Direct** — say what the number means, don't bury it.
- **Neutral** — inform without alarming. A low score is a signal, not a
  judgment.
- **Actionable** — if there's something the user can do, tell them.
- **No jargon without context** — "utilization" is fine in a label;
  "delinquency ratio" is not.

## Risk-explainer sentences

One sentence per band, derived from `RISK_COLOR(score)`:

| Band        | Threshold | Message |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| success     | >= 700    | Strong credit position — you're above the recommended threshold for new draws. |
| warning     | >= 600    | Fair credit position — within acceptable range, though keep an eye on your utilization. |
| danger      | < 600     | Below the recommended threshold — consider improving your score before new draws. |

## Glossary

Every term that appears in the UI should be used consistently. When a term
needs an inline gloss, the gloss text below is canonical.

| Term | Canonical label | Gloss definition (for AccessibleTooltip) | Do use | Don't use |
|------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|
| Draw | Draw amount | A draw is the amount of credit you choose to receive from your available credit line. | "Draw amount", "draw from your credit line" | "credit event", "loan disbursement" |
| Repay | Repayment amount | A repayment reduces your outstanding balance and frees up available credit. | "Repayment amount", "repay", "outstanding debt" | "paydown", "debt settlement" |
| Utilization | Utilization | Utilization is the percentage of your available credit that is currently being used. | "Utilization", "credit utilization" | "balance ratio", "usage rate" |
| Reserve | Reserve | A reserve is the portion of your credit line that should stay untouched for safety and flexibility. | "Reserve", "wallet reserve", "credit reserve" | "minimum floor", "buffer" |
| APR | APR | APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is the yearly cost of borrowing, including fees and interest. | "APR", "annual percentage rate" | "interest rate" (when APR is meant) |
| Attestation | Attestation | An attestation is a cryptographically signed statement that verifies your identity or credit data. | "Attestation", "verify" | "certification", "notarization" |
| Term | Term | A term is a defined period or condition of your credit agreement. | "Term", "terms and conditions" | "tenor", "covenant" |
| Healthy | Healthy | Healthy means your credit position is strong and within the recommended thresholds. | "Healthy", "strong credit position" | "good", "excellent" (use numeric score instead) |

## Landing Page Hero CTA Variants

The landing hero copy is managed in `src/copy/landing.ts` with deterministic A/B variant selection per session (seeded by date).

| Variant | Title | Subtitle | Primary CTA | Secondary CTA | Intent |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| `control` | Adaptive Credit Without Overcollateralization | Credit limits that evolve with your on-chain behavior. No locked capital. No static risk models. Just programmable credit. | Connect Wallet | Learn More | Current baseline — emphasizes absence of collateral requirement |
| `variant_a` | Credit That Grows With You — No Collateral Needed | Your on-chain history powers a living credit limit. No lockup, no static model — just capital that adapts to how you build. | Get Started | See How It Works | Growth-focused — positions credit as an evolving resource |
| `variant_b` | Unlock On-Chain Credit Without Locking Assets | Behavior-based lending powered by Stellar smart contracts. Your activity defines your limit — not your collateral. | Claim Your Credit | Explore the Protocol | Action-oriented — frames credit as an unlockable asset |

Selection is deterministic: `getVariant()` hashes the current date (YYYY-MM-DD) and selects a variant via modulo. The same user on the same day always sees the same variant.

To add a new variant:
1. Add the id to `VariantId` type in `src/copy/landing.ts`
2. Add the copy to `HERO_VARIANTS` record
3. Document the variant in this table

## Label conventions
